Balloon Burst Game
The Balloon Burst Game is a fun and interactive web-based game built with Phaser.js. In this game, players inflate a balloon by clicking on a pump button. The goal is to inflate the balloon until it reaches its maximum size, at which point the balloon will fly away. The player must try to burst the balloon by clicking on it before it flies off the screen. The game features charming balloon characters, colorful graphics, and engaging mechanics that keep players entertained.
